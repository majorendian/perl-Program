Revision history for Perl extension "Program"

This programs versioning system is as follows:
  major.minor_patch 
  or
  major.minorp<N> - where N is a patch number so for example:
    v0.07p5 - major 0, minor 07, patch 5
      the above is equivalent to v0.07_5


Each <EVEN> number represents a <STABLE> release
while each <ODD> number represents a <DEVELOPMENT> release

  - Changed the return value for Rules* functions
      it now returns an array in list context and a
      packed scalar value in scalar context
      The scalar value can be unpacked with `unpack("C*", $result)`	
  - As of this version, automatic deployment is being done by
      Tracis CI on each tagged commit
  - Added documentation for RulesLinear function and other smaller
      functions

  - Added more functions to core module Program
      like `randomchoice`, `funcall` and `in`
  - Finished `RulesLinear` function. Now returns a sub with proper
      list of generated values based on an simple interger-driven
      rule-set
  - Changed the `in` function to return either true or false
      if an element is in the list
  - More tests to validate program correctness	
  - This package now depends on:
      Carp, List::Util, Data::Dumper, Test::More
      All of which ship with perl itself, except maybe Test::More

0.03  2021-10-23 16:11
  - Added Rules, RulesLinear, RulesMatrix, RulesLinearRandom functions
    Only RulesLinearRandom is exported and tested working
  - Changed lambda function to lambda(&;@) to accept optional
      second param
  - Additionally slightly changed the way parameters are handled
  - Added `list` function to easily create lists with `map`
